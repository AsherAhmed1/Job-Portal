# Job-Portal in MERN Stack
This is a project which I have completed in an internship for CodSoft.

In both of the folder run (npm install) command

by typing this command : npx create-react-app frontend   => when you have entered this command node_modules folder will be created automatically

and to use backend code first you have to run all the commands => npm init, and all the rest of the commands
